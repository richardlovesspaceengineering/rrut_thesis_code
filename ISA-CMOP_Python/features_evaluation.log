 ~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW Analysis for MW11_d10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Initialising normalisation computations for RW samples. This requires full evaluation of the entire sample set and may take some time while still being memory-efficient.
Evaluated the normalisation values for this sample set in 3.10 seconds.

Running parallel computation for RW features with 2 processes. 

Removed 5 NaN entries for eps_s when concatenating within-sample feature arrays.
