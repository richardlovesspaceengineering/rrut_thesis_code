 ~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW Analysis for MW3_d10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Initialising normalisation computations for RW samples. This requires full evaluation of the entire sample set and may take some time while still being memory-efficient.
Evaluated the normalisation values for this sample set in 277.76 seconds.
Had to remove 139 rows that were further than the nadir from the origin.
There are no non-dominated neighbours closer to the origin than the nadir for step 1 of 861. Setting HV metric bhv_avg to 0.
Evaluated RW features in 639.87 seconds.
