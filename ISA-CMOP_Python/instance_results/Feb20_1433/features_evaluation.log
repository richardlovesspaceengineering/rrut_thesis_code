 ~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW Analysis for CTP1_d5 ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

[2024-02-20 14:34:12] Initialising normalisation computations for RW samples using 6 cores. This requires full evaluation of the entire sample set and may take some time while still being memory-efficient.
[2024-02-20 14:57:28] Evaluated the normalisation values for this sample set in 1396.48 seconds.
