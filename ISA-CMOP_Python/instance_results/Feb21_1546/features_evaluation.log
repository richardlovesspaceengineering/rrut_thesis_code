[2024-02-21 15:46:48] Creating a single population to initialise PF.

Summary of cores allocation (have taken the minimum of self.num_samples and num_cores except for larger-dimension global cases):
RW processes will use 3 cores.
AW processes will use 3 cores.
Global processes will use 3 cores.

 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW Analysis for CTP1_d5 ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

[2024-02-21 15:46:48] Initialising normalisation computations for RW samples using 3 cores. This requires full evaluation of the entire sample set and may take some time while still being memory-efficient.
Generating RW population for sample 1, walk 1 as it was not found.
