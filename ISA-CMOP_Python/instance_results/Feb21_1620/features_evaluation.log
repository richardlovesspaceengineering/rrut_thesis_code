[2024-02-21 16:20:05] Creating a single population to initialise PF.

Summary of cores allocation (have taken the minimum of self.num_samples and num_cores except for larger-dimension global cases):
RW processes will use 6 cores.
AW processes will use 15 cores.
Global processes will use 15 cores.

[2024-02-21 16:20:11] Initialising normalisation computations for RW samples using 6 cores. This requires full evaluation of the entire sample set and may take some time while still being memory-efficient.
